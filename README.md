# Meeting memo
This GitHub page hosts a Python-based project that leverages the OpenAI's Whisper and Pyannote's Speaker Diarization libraries to process WAV audio files. The core functionality of this application is to analyze audio input, accurately transcribing spoken words while identifying and labeling different speakers throughout the recording. The project is structured to facilitate easy interaction with the Whisper model for efficient speech-to-text conversion, and integrates Pyannote's advanced algorithms for distinguishing between speakers, enabling the generation of transcripts that not only provide the textual content of the audio but also indicate who said what at any given time. This makes the tool particularly useful for processing interviews, meetings, podcasts, or any audio with multiple speakers, providing clear and detailed transcriptions that enhance accessibility and understanding of the content.
